 How we distribute vaccines
 Stanford Health Care follows the California Department of Public Health’s guidelines to determine which groups are eligible for vaccination. Our process is also influenced by our available vaccine supply, which is set by local county health authorities. As eligible groups and vaccine supplies change rapidly, access to vaccine appointments is also variable.
 Other options for vaccination
 Many Stanford Health Care patients may have access to vaccine through resources beyond those offered by Stanford Health Care. We encourage you to get vaccinated where convenient and in the most safe and timely manner possible. We will continue to update you as more vaccines are received and made available for distribution and will continue to partner with our local county health authorities to reach individuals who do not have access to primary care providers.
 Please continue to visit this page for updates.
To learn more about other options for Vaccination, please see our FAQs.
 Vaccination FAQs
 FAQ
 When can I get the COVID-19 vaccine?
 Timing of vaccine eligibility is set by the California Department of Public Health, with phases defined by age and in some cases occupation. Please visit this page for the very latest information and regular updates as new groups are added for vaccination in the weeks and months to come.
 FAQ
 What requirements are needed for vaccination at Stanford Health Care?
 Patients who have had care at least once in the past three years with Stanford Health Care, and who meet current eligibility requirements set by the state and county, may schedule vaccination at Stanford Health Care.
 FAQ
 Besides Stanford Health Care, where else can I get vaccinated?
 Many Stanford Health Care patients may have access to vaccine through county resources beyond those offered by Stanford Health Care. We encourage you to get vaccinated where convenient and in the most safe and timely manner possible. We will continue to update you as more vaccines are received and made available for distribution, and will continue to partner with our local county health authorities to reach individuals who do not have access to primary care providers.
 FAQ
 If the vaccination is free, why do I need to provide insurance?
 The actual vaccination purchased and distributed by government agencies is free of charge. However, there is a cost to administer the vaccination. This cost will be billed and paid by your insurance or government program. Patients will not be billed for any out-of-pocket costs for the vaccine and administration.
 FAQ
 My Medicare or Medi-Cal is through an HMO program. Why do I need to provide my Medicare number (MBI) or Medi-Cal number (BIC)?
 Medicare and Medi-Cal have provided guidance that the vaccine administration should be billed directly to the government program instead of the HMO to simplify the administration and tracking. We require the correct member ID number to properly bill/report to the government program. Patients will not be billed for any out of pocket costs for the vaccine and administration.
